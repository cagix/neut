# Installation

## Installation

To install the compiler toolchain, execute [the installation script](github.com/vekatze/neut/TBD):

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vekatze/neut/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then please follow the instructions.

You may also want to [configure your editor](./editor-setup.md).

If you prefer manual installation, see [here](./manual-installation.md).

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the toolchain, just remove the following two:

- the binary `~/.local/bin/neut`
- the directory `~/.cache/neut/`

Neut won't clutter your PC.
