# Installation

## Installation

To install the compiler, execute the installation script:

```sh
curl -sSL https://github.com/(..) | sh

and follow the instructions. You may also want to [configure your editor](./editor-support.md).

If you prefer manual installation, see [Manual Installation](./manual-installation.md).

## Uninstallation

For uninstallation, just remove the following two:

- the binary `~/.local/bin/neut`
- the directory `~/.cache/neut/`
