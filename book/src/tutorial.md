Neut is a _module-based_ _functional_ programming language with _static_ memory management. This chapter is a quick introduction to this language.

In [Hello External World](./hello-external-world.md), we will see Neut's _"module-based"_ aspect. We will see how to use modules in Neut. You'll know how to create, build, execute, and release your modules.

In [Programming in Neut](./programming-in-neut.md), we will see Neut's _"functional"_ aspect. We'll see how to write code in Neut.

In [Static Memory Management](./static-memory-management.md), we will see Neut's _"static"_ aspect. We will see how to handle memory operations in Neut. We'll also see Neut's technique to optimize memory allocation.
