# Tutorial

Neut is a _module-based_ _functional_ programming language with _static_ memory management via _modality_. This chapter is a quick introduction to this language.

In [Hello External World](./hello-external-world.md), we will see Neut's _"module-based"_ aspect. We will see how to use modules in Neut. You'll know how to create, build, execute, and release your modules.

In [Programming in Neut](./programming-in-neut.md), we will see Neut's _"functional"_ aspect. We'll see how to write code in Neut.

In [Static Memory Management](./static-memory-management.md), we will see Neut's _"static"_ aspect. We will see how to handle memory operations in Neut. We'll also see Neut's technique to optimize memory allocation.

In [Modality and Memory](./modality-and-memory.md), we will see how Neut utilizes _modality_, especially the T-necessity operator, in its memory management.

This chapter assumes you are familiar with languages like Haskell, OCaml, or F#.
