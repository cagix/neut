# Tutorial

Neut is a _module-based_ _functional_ programming language with _static_ memory management via _modality_. This chapter is a quick introduction to this language.

[Hello Modules](./hello-modules.md) covers the _"module-based"_ part. We'll see how to use modules in Neut.

[Programming in Neut](./programming-in-neut.md) covers the _"functional"_ part. We'll see how to write code in Neut.

[Static Memory Management](./static-memory-management.md) covers the _"static"_ part. We'll see how memory is managed in Neut. We'll also see Neut's technique to optimize memory allocation.

[Modality and Memory](./modality-and-memory.md) covers the _"modality"_ part. We'll see how memory operations introduced in the previous section can be understood via modality.

This chapter assumes you are familiar with languages like Haskell, OCaml, or F#.
