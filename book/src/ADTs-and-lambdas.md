# ADTs and Lambdas

In this section, we'll see how to use the key colors of Neut: algebraic data types and lambdas.

Examples in this section can be downloaded as follows:

```sh
git clone <insert-link-here>
```

## Algebraic Data Types

### Basics

Let's see how to write actual code. Firstly, you can define an algebraic data type like below:

```neut
// Defining an algebraic data type
data my-list(a) {
- MyNil
- MyCons(a, my-list(a))
}

// nullary data types are also allowed
data test {
- Foo
- Bar
}
```

and use it like the below:

```neut
define create-my-list(): my-list(int) {
  MyCons(1, MyCons(2, MyNil))
}

define get-length[a](xs: my-list(a)): int {
  // pattern matching against a my-list
  match xs {
  - MyNil =>
    0
  - MyCons(1, MyNil) => // nested pattern matching is available
    1
  - MyCons(_, rest) =>
    add-int(1, get-length(rest))
  }
}
```

The name of a constructor must start with an uppercase letter.

Incidentally, the `[a]` at the definition of `get-length` specifies implicit arguments. Without that, `get-length` will become:

```neut
// `tau` is the type of types.
define get-length(a: tau, xs: my-list(a)): int {
  match xs { // pattern matching against a my-list
  - MyNil =>
    1
  - MyCons(_, rest) =>
    add-int(1, get-length(a, rest)) // recursion
  }
}
```

which might not be what you want, because you need to pass the type `a` every time you call this function.

You can specify multiple implicit arguments by writing, for example, `[a, b, c, d]`.

### Memory Behavior

When calling a constructor, memory for the constructor is allocated. The internal representation of things like `MyCons(1, Nil)` is:

```neut
(pointer-to-a, discriminant, 1, pointer-to-Nil) // 4-word tuple
```

where the `discriminant` is an integer that is used to distinguish constructors; In this case, the actual value for `MyCons` will be 1. That of `MyNil` will be 0.

When `match` is used against a value of an ADT, the inner values of the given value are extracted, and the unnecessary data is freed. For example, if the given value is `MyCons(1, Nil)`, the following will happen:

1. the `1` and `pointer-to-Nil` are extracted to be used later,
2. the `pointer-to-a` is discarded along its type `tau`, and
3. the outer 4-word tuple is freed.

---

Also, if an ADT and all its constructor don't need any arguments, the internal representation of the type is optimized into an enum. For example, consider the following code:

```neut
data color {
- Red
- Blue
- Green
}
```

Then, the internal representation of `Red` is optimized into `0`. That of `Blue` is optimized into `1`, and so on.

## Lambdas

### Basics

You can create a lambda abstraction (anonymous function) and use it as an ordinary function:

```neut
define sample(): int {
  let inc = (x) => { add-int(x) } // create a lambda function int -> int
  inc(10) // and call it
}
```

Also, the type of functions is written as follows in Neut:

```neut
define sample(): int {
  let type1 = int -> int         // receives int          / returns int
  let type2 = (int, bool) -> int // receives int and bool / returns int
  let type3 = () -> int          // receives nothing      / returns int
  0
}
```

### Keyword Arguments

Neut has keyword arguments like the below:

```neut
define some-function(a: int, some-argument: tau, b: tau): int {
  // ...
}

define caller(): int {
  let _ =
    some-function {
    - b = tau
    - a = 20
    - some-argument = tau
    }
  0
}

```

Keyword arguments can be used with a constructor:

```neut
define create-struct(): config(my-list(int)) {
  // create a struct using keyword arguments
  Config {
  - foo = 30
  - bar = MyNil
  - some-value = MyCons(3, MyNil)
  }
}
```

### Memory Behavior

A `lambda` is compiled into a three-word tuple:

```neut
(type-of-free-variables, (freevar-1, ..., freevar-n), pointer-to-closed-function)
```

When you call a lambda, things like below will happen:

```neut
cls(a, b, c)

// â†“

// let type-of-free-variables = cls[0] (unused)
let free-variables = cls[1]
let closed-function = cls[2]
free(cls) // free the outer tuple
closed-function(a, b, c, free-variables)
```

## Other Basic Types

Basic types (integers, floats, bools, etc.) are also available in Neut, of course. This will be covered in [the last section of this chapter](./other-built-in-utilities.md).

## How Can I Say Hello to The World?

The above should cover the basics of Neut. Still, it won't suffice; We can't even do the beloved Hello World now. This is because the type of static text is a noetic type, which is covered in the next section. Let's go ahead.
