# Language Tour

In this chapter, we'll see how to use the language in practice. After finishing this chapter, you should be able to write, run, and distribute your program.

[The Section 3.1 (Installation)](./installation.md) covers how to install Neut. Pre-built binaries are available for some platforms; You can also build a binary by yourself.

[The Section 3.2 (Basics by Examples)](./basics-by-examples.md) explains how to write basic programs in Neut. Although this section technically assumes some familiarity with languages like Haskell or OCaml, I believe you can read the section without much difficulty if you know programming basics.

[The Section 3.3 (Noetic Programming)](./noetic-programming.md) explains how to use a noema. Using a noema, you can avoid unnecessary cloning operations. This is essential when you write an efficient program.

[The Section 3.4 (Namespaces and Modules)](./namespaces-and-modules.md) explains how namespaces and modules work in Neut. The module system of Neut is special in that it takes advantage of checksums. The section also explains how to share your works with others. You'll see how the Semantic Versioning has practical significance in Neut.

[The Section 3.5 (Parallelism and Mutability)](./parallelism-and-mutability.md) explains how to accomplish parallelism in Neut. You'll also see how channels can be used as mutable variables.
