# Language Tour

In this chapter, we'll see how to use the language in practice. After finishing this chapter, you should be able to write, run, and distribute your program.

[The Section 3.1 (Installation)](./installation.md) covers how to install Neut. Pre-built binaries are available for some platforms; You can also build a binary by yourself.

[The Section 3.2 (Basics by Examples)](./basics-by-examples.md) explains how to write basic programs in Neut. Although this section technically assumes some familiarity with languages like Haskell or OCaml, I believe you can read the section without much difficulty if you know programming basics.

[The Section 3.3 (Noetic Programming)](./noetic-programming.md) explains how to use a noema. Using a noema, you can avoid unnecessary cloning operations. This is essential when you write an efficient program.

[The Section 3.4 (Parallelism and Mutability)](./parallelism-and-mutability.md) explains how to accomplish parallelism in Neut. You'll also see how channels can be used as mutable variables.
