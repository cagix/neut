# Language Tour

In this chapter, we'll see how to use the language in practice. After finishing this chapter, you should be able to write, run, and distribute your program.

[Section 3.1 (Installation)](./installation.md) covers how to install Neut. Pre-built binaries are available for some platforms; You can also build a binary by yourself.

[Section 3.2 (Preliminaries)](./preliminaries.md) explains how to create and build a module. We'll also see the basics of memory management in Neut. That is, we'll see what happens when a variable is used non-linearly.

[Section 3.3 (ADTs and Lambdas)](./ADTs-and-lambdas.md) explains how to write basic terms in Neut. We'll also see their memory behaviors.

[Section 3.4 (Noetic Programming)](./noetic-programming.md) explains how to use a noema to avoid unnecessary cloning operations. This is essential when you write an efficient program.

[Section 3.5 (Parallelism and Mutability)](./parallelism-and-mutability.md) explains how to accomplish parallelism in Neut. You'll also see how channels can be used as mutable variables.

[Section 3.6 (Other Built-in Utilities)](./other-built-in-utilities.md) explains how to use built-in types, primitive types, etc. This section also covers other utility features like inline functions.
