# Main Ideas

In this chapter, we'll see how Neut realizes static memory management.

We need a short prologue for our plot, however. That is, we need to see the fact that static memory management is almost trivial *if every variable is used exactly once (= linearly)*. This is done in [the Section 3.1 (Paradise of Linearity)](./paradise-of-linearity.md).

And the real story begins. Neut's approach to static memory management is twofold:

1. It firstly finds *a "fair" way* to compile the Î»-calculus consistently, and then
2. spots out some *"cheatable" fragments* in the calculus.

Here, the consistent way is to translate types into functions than know how to copy/discard the terms of the types. This is explained in [the Section 3.2 (Executing Types)](./executing-types.md).

You'll see that the consistent way can sometimes result in an unsatisfactory runtime performance. [The Section 3.3 (Noetic Optimization)](./noetic-optimization.md) provides a loophole to achieve better performance.

Let's start from linearity.
