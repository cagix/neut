Neut is a dependently-typed programming language with static memory management.

Its key features include:

- Full λ-calculus support
- Static memory management
- The absence of annotations to the type system when achieving both of the above

I believe the last one is particularly interesting, as it means Neut found memory predictability inside the usual λ-calculus.
